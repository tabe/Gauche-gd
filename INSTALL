Basic
=====

It is necessary to:
- use gauche 0.8.7 or later
- have been installed the gd2 library (version 2.0.28 or higher)

It is recommended to:
- have gdlib-config in PATH


Command lines
=============

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install


Distribution Specific
=====================

* Debian (sarge)
If you do not have the gd2 library, then:
# apt-get install libgd2-dev

* Fedora Core 5
If you do not have the gd2 library, then:
# yum install gd-devel

* Cygwin
I have succeeded in installing it with Cygwin DLL 1.5.21-1 (Windows XP).
Good luck! :-)
