Basic
=====

It is necessary to:
- use gauche 0.8.7 or later
- have been installed the gd2 library (version 2.0.28 or higher)

It is recommended to:
- have gdlib-config in PATH


Command lines
=============

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check    # optional
# make install

Or more simply,
# gauche-package install Gauche-gd-0.2.0.tgz


Distribution Specific
=====================

* Debian (etch)
If you do not have the gd2 library, then:
# aptitude install libgd2-dev

* Fedora 8
If you do not have the gd2 library, then:
# yum install gd-devel

* FreeBSD 6.2
# cd /usr/ports/graphics/gd
# make install clean
Also available: /usr/ports/japanese/gd.
You will need to ./configure CPPFLAGS=-l/usr/local/include for gd.h,
and gmake instead of make.

* Cygwin
I have succeeded in installing it with Cygwin DLL 1.5.21-1 (Windows XP).
Good luck! :-)


Tips
====

* Failure on test
You may fail to "make check" like:

Testing graphics.gd ...                                          gd-jpeg: JPEG library reports unrecoverable error: Empty input file
failed.
discrepancies found.  Errors are:
test gd-image-string-ft(upper-right) with #f: expects (273 . 58) => got (273 . 59)
test gd-image-string-ft(upper-left) with #f: expects (29 . 58) => got (29 . 59)
test gd-image-string-ft(upper-right): expects (273 . 58) => got (273 . 59)
test gd-image-string-ft(upper-left): expects (29 . 58) => got (29 . 59)

which is no problem, since something wrong were only some values of the cooridinates.
